# Packaging LSL
Replace the contents of `source.html` with your index.html. Please leave the `index.html` alone. You can add any other needed files such as `styles.css` or something else. Then you can deploy your project anywhere, with it running LSL!
## Find better documentation on the [L.IDE docs](https://lorenzolikesstuff.gitbook.io/l.ide-docs/running-lsl-in-web).
